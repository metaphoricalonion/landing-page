# landing-page
I will be creating a simple landing page. I will be using HTML, CSS and the Flexbox layout model to create this page. 

**Skills I have demonstrated in this project:**
- Layout all the different items in the page using Flexbox
- Use HTML to add all the contents of the page
- Use CSS to style the page
- Separate the page into different sections
- Keep my commits atomic
